# Writing a guide
So, you want to write your own hints for a game? That's cool. Every game should have spoiler free hints! Best place to start is [this template repository](https://github.com/nice-game-hints/template). It has examples and the following instructions.

<p class="hidden">
Fill this README.md with something you want to tell _a contributor_. This README is not shown in the www.nicegamehints.com site.

# Concepts of a game hint repository
The concepts for the NGH hints are **a game** that contains multiple **guides**. **A guide** has multiple **hints** that the reader can then reveal one by one. **A guide** can also have **subguides**.

Guide files are written using [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) language.

## index.md - Metadata about the game
The one required file is `index.md`. This file defines the name of the game and other metadata for the game. Example `index.md` looks like this:
```markdown
---
title: Deponia Doomsday
keywords: deponia doomsday, guide
author: Juho Rutila
praise: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jrutila
---

Welcome to spoiler free hints for Deponia Doomsday! Select a guide.
```

The part between `---` lines is _metadata_:
 - _title_: The name of the game that is shown in the page and page title etc.
 - _keywords_: list of keywords to help search engines
 - _author_: Your name. Shown under every guide.
 - _praise_: buymeacoffee.com url to ask readers to give you money for your hard work with the guide.

The rest of the text is markdown shown in the first page of the guide.

## Guide file
A guide file is just a md file containing the hints with headers. Example of a guide file:
```markdown
---
title: How to get tin foil?
keywords: tin foil, baked potato
---

This text is shown first to the reader and it is also visible in Google snippet.

# Show the first hint
Everything until the next `#` line is part of the first hint

# Show the second hint
This is the contents of the second hint.
```

Again, the guide file starts with mandatory metadata:
 - _title_: Title of the guide shown in the subguide buttons and as the page title for example in Google listings
 - _keywords_: list of keywords to help search engines
 
The following text is shown to the user straight away so don't give up the solution here yet! It is also shown in Google's listings as they have a preview of the page. The actual hints are not shown in Google.

Every `#` line (markdown's header) denotes one hint under the guide. That text is shown in the hint button so don't make it too long. It can be as simple as "Hint 1", "Hint 2" etc.

## Subguides
Guides form a folder structure. All the folders and md files under the guide's folder form the subguides. Under the guide folder a `index.md` file is required. Example of guide folder structure:
```
ðŸ“¦ repository root
 â”£ ðŸ“œ index.md
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ 01-first-part-of-the-game
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ index.md
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ 010-subguide.md
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚ 020-subguide-for-first-part
 â”ƒ   â”— ðŸ“œ index.md
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ 02-second-part-of-the-game
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ index.md
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ 010-subguide.md
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ 020-another.md
```

Subguides are listed in alphabetical order so it is suggested to use numbering to name the files. The file name is only visible in browser location bar.

## Linking between the guides
To link to another guide you write markdown's links. Here is an example guide file.:
```markdown
---
title: How to get tin foil?
---

Guide for tin foil.

# Show the first hint
First, you need [a hot potato](030-potato.md). This will link to another guide file that is in the same folder as the guide file.

# Show the second hint
Next, you need [a potato peeler](../040-potato-peeler/index.md). This will link to another subguide that is in parent folder.

# Show the third hint
Finally, get [a permission to peel](/04-fourth-part-of-the-game/010-permission.md). This will link starting from the root of the guide folder structure.
```

## background.jpg
You can add a file named `background.jpg` in the root folder of you guide. That image will be used as the background image of the guide.
